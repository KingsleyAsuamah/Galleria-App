DBS GALLERIA README
===================
Galleria is an Andriod app that takes pictures using the camera on the device and stores them in the App's proprietary Gallery. 
You can also add other pictures from your phone gallery to the app.
There is an extended feature to upload images from the app gallery to any server or location on the cloud. This makes the app suitable for data collection purposes that involves taking pictures and sharing or sending to a remote location.
For this project, I used an Azure server at first, but had to change to a free test PHP server; https://mikayil.com/json.php due to cost concerns.
The location can be configured to suite user's demand.
